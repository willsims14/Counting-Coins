#Temperature Converter
This program reads a temperature (in celsius or fahrenheit), and then (using two radio buttons) the user chooses whether to convert the degrees to fahrenheit or celsius. If the temperature is low, the background-color is blue. If the temperature is high, the background-color is red. Otherwise, the background-color is green.
